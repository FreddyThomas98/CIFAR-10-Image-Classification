This  project implements a deep learning solution for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it accurately categorizes 32x32 color images into ten predefined classes. With clear documentation and organized code, it serves as a valuable resource for understanding image classification workflows and implementing cutting-edge deep learning techniques
